# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

### I'm snipermothlord (UEF student • Aspiring Game Dev • Backend & LLM Enthusiast)

Hi there! I'm currently studying at the **University of Eastern Finland** and navigating the wild world of code, caffeine, and creativity. I’m deeply interested in game development and backend engineering — and lately, I’ve been diving into the exciting world of **large language models (LLMs)**.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

- 🎮 Learning game dev with Unity & Godot (mostly side projects for now)
- 🛠️ Exploring backend frameworks like **Django**, **FastAPI**, and **Node.js**
- 🧠 Experimenting with LLM APIs & fine-tuning open-source models
- ✍️ Building small tools, bots, and automation scripts

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Rust & C++ for performance-critical projects
- Databases (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- ML fundamentals and huggingface 🤗 tools
- Clean architecture & software design principles
